# Security Audit Report - Visual Relationship Network

**Date**: Current  
**Auditor**: Security Review  
**Application**: Visual Relationship Network v1.0  

## Executive Summary

This application implements **end-to-end encryption** for sensitive relationship network data using AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation. After comprehensive security review, the implementation follows industry best practices for client-side encryption.

## ‚úÖ Security Strengths

### 1. Encryption Implementation (EXCELLENT)
**File**: `src/lib/encryption.ts`

- ‚úÖ **AES-256-GCM**: Uses authenticated encryption preventing tampering
- ‚úÖ **PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations**: Strong key derivation resistant to brute-force
- ‚úÖ **Random IV per encryption**: Each file gets unique 12-byte IV (proper for GCM)
- ‚úÖ **Random salt per encryption**: 16-byte salt prevents rainbow table attacks
- ‚úÖ **Web Crypto API**: Uses browser's native, audited cryptographic primitives
- ‚úÖ **No key storage**: Encryption keys are derived on-demand and never persisted

**Encryption Flow**:
```
User Password ‚Üí PBKDF2 (100k iterations, SHA-256, 16-byte salt) ‚Üí 256-bit AES-GCM Key
Plaintext Data + Key + 12-byte IV ‚Üí AES-GCM Encryption ‚Üí Ciphertext
Output: {iv, salt, data} all Base64-encoded
```

### 2. Data Flow Security (EXCELLENT)
**Files**: `FileManager.tsx`, `WorkspaceView.tsx`

- ‚úÖ **No server transmission**: All encryption/decryption happens in browser
- ‚úÖ **Local file storage only**: Encrypted files download to user's computer
- ‚úÖ **Never uploads data**: Zero network requests for workspace data
- ‚úÖ **No third-party services**: No analytics, no cloud sync, no telemetry
- ‚úÖ **Zero-knowledge architecture**: Even if someone had the files, they cannot decrypt without password

### 3. File Handling (EXCELLENT)

- ‚úÖ **Encrypted file format**: Files are `.enc.json` with encrypted payload
- ‚úÖ **No plaintext export**: Only encrypted files can be downloaded
- ‚úÖ **Graceful decryption failures**: Wrong password shows error, doesn't crash
- ‚úÖ **File integrity**: AES-GCM's authentication prevents file tampering

### 4. Memory Security (ACCEPTABLE)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Decrypted data in memory**: Required for application functionality
  - **Justification**: Application MUST decrypt data to display/edit it
  - **Risk Level**: LOW - browser memory is process-isolated
  - **Mitigation**: Data only lives in current tab, cleared on tab close
  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Password in memory during session**: Kept to allow re-encryption on save
  - **Justification**: Necessary to save changes without re-prompting for password every edit
  - **Risk Level**: LOW - same browser memory isolation applies
  - **Mitigation**: Password cleared when user creates/loads new network

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations (By Design)

### 1. Browser Memory Contains Decrypted Data
**Status**: EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

Once a file is decrypted, the workspace data exists in plaintext in JavaScript memory. This is unavoidable for any application that needs to display and edit encrypted data.

**Risk Assessment**: LOW
- Browser tabs are process-isolated
- Memory is cleared when tab closes
- No memory persistence across sessions
- No access from other websites (Same-Origin Policy)

**Recommendation**: ACCEPT - This is the security model for all client-side encrypted applications

### 2. Password Kept in Component State
**Status**: ACCEPTABLE FOR USE CASE

The password is stored in React state during the session to enable:
- Re-encryption when saving changes
- Updating the download link as user edits

**Risk Assessment**: LOW
- Password only in current tab's memory
- Cleared when switching to different network
- Never transmitted or persisted
- Protected by browser's process isolation

**Alternative**: Require password re-entry on every save
**Trade-off**: Severely degrades UX for questionable security gain

**Recommendation**: ACCEPT - Current approach balances security and usability

### 3. Auto-Generated Download Links
**Status**: SECURE

The app maintains an always-current encrypted file via `URL.createObjectURL()`.

**Security Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Blob URLs are scoped to current document origin
- ‚úÖ Data is ENCRYPTED in the blob
- ‚úÖ URL revoked on component unmount
- ‚úÖ Cannot be accessed from other tabs/windows

**Recommendation**: ACCEPT - This is secure and provides good UX

## üîí Trust Nobody Architecture - VERIFIED ‚úÖ

The application successfully implements a "trust nobody" philosophy:

### Zero Trust Principles Met:

1. ‚úÖ **No server trust**: No backend, no server-side decryption possible
2. ‚úÖ **No cloud storage trust**: All files stored locally by user
3. ‚úÖ **No network trust**: Zero data transmission (except downloading encrypted files to user's own machine)
4. ‚úÖ **No storage trust**: Only encrypted data touches disk
5. ‚úÖ **No third-party trust**: No external services, APIs, or analytics
6. ‚úÖ **Browser isolation trust boundary**: Relies only on browser's security model (industry standard)

### What This Means:

- **Files are encrypted at rest**: ‚úÖ YES - `.enc.json` files contain only ciphertext
- **Files are encrypted in transit**: ‚úÖ N/A - No transit, local files only
- **Only decrypted in browser**: ‚úÖ YES - Decryption occurs client-side only
- **Password never transmitted**: ‚úÖ YES - Password never leaves user's device
- **No cloud dependency**: ‚úÖ YES - Fully offline-capable
- **No password recovery**: ‚úÖ CORRECT - Lost password = lost data (expected for zero-knowledge)

## üéØ Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions: NONE REQUIRED ‚úÖ
The current implementation meets security best practices for client-side encryption.

### Optional Enhancements (Low Priority):

1. **Add Security Warnings**:
   - Inform users that password loss means data loss
   - Warn users to keep encrypted files safe
   - Explain the security model clearly

2. **Password Strength Indicator**:
   - Visual feedback for password strength
   - Recommend minimum 12+ characters
   - Warn against common passwords

3. **Memory Clearing on Sensitive Actions**:
   - Explicitly null out decrypted data when switching networks
   - Clear password reference when navigating away

4. **CSP Headers** (if served from web server):
   - Content-Security-Policy to prevent XSS
   - Restrict script sources to self only

5. **File Format Version**:
   - Add version field to encrypted format
   - Allows future cryptographic algorithm upgrades

## üîê Threat Model Analysis

### Threats PROTECTED Against:

| Threat | Protection | Effectiveness |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Network interception** | No network transmission | ‚úÖ PERFECT |
| **Server compromise** | No server exists | ‚úÖ PERFECT |
| **Cloud provider access** | No cloud storage | ‚úÖ PERFECT |
| **File theft** | AES-256-GCM encryption | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |
| **Password guessing** | PBKDF2 100k iterations | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |
| **File tampering** | GCM authentication | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |
| **Brute force** | Strong KDF + user password strength | ‚úÖ GOOD |
| **Rainbow tables** | Random salt per file | ‚úÖ EXCELLENT |

### Threats NOT Protected Against:

| Threat | Risk | Mitigation Available |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| **Weak user passwords** | HIGH | Require strong passwords, add strength meter |
| **User loses password** | HIGH | NONE - By design (zero-knowledge) |
| **Malicious browser extensions** | MEDIUM | User responsibility, can't control |
| **Physical machine access** | MEDIUM | OS-level security, disk encryption |
| **Memory dumps (if machine compromised)** | LOW | Not feasible to prevent in browser context |
| **Keyloggers on user's machine** | MEDIUM | User responsibility, antivirus |
| **Screen recording** | MEDIUM | User responsibility, secure environment |

## Final Verdict: ‚úÖ SECURITY REQUIREMENTS MET

**Overall Security Rating**: EXCELLENT for client-side encrypted application

The Visual Relationship Network successfully implements:
- ‚úÖ End-to-end encryption
- ‚úÖ Zero-knowledge architecture  
- ‚úÖ Trust nobody philosophy
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard cryptography
- ‚úÖ No data leakage to servers/cloud
- ‚úÖ Local-only storage
- ‚úÖ Secure by default

**Conclusion**: The application's security model is sound and appropriate for the use case. All data is encrypted before leaving the browser's memory to disk, and only decrypted within the browser for display/editing. This matches the security model of industry-standard tools like 1Password, Bitwarden, and other client-side encryption applications.
