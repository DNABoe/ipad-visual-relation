2. GitHub Actions workflow triggers
   ↓
3. Workflow installs dependencies (npm ci)
   ↓
4. Workflow builds application (npm run build)
   ↓
5. Build outputs to dist/ folder
   ↓
6. CNAME and .nojekyll copied from public/
   ↓
7. Workflow uploads dist/ as artifact
   ↓
8. Workflow deploys to GitHub Pages
