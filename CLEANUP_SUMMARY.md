# Code Cleanup Summary

## Issue Identified
You had two versions of the WorkspaceView component:
- `WorkspaceView.tsx` - Old monolithic version (~1672 lines)
- `WorkspaceView2.tsx` - New refactored version (~395 lines)

The app was using `WorkspaceView2.tsx`, making the old file completely unused.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Replaced Old WorkspaceView.tsx
- Overwrote `WorkspaceView.tsx` with the content from `WorkspaceView2.tsx`
- This is the clean, refactored version that uses custom hooks for better separation of concerns

### 2. Updated Import in App.tsx
- Changed from: `import { WorkspaceView } from './components/WorkspaceView2'`
- Changed to: `import { WorkspaceView } from './components/WorkspaceView'`

## Result
✅ **No more duplication** - There is now only one WorkspaceView component
✅ **No conflicts** - The clean, refactored version is now the primary component
✅ **Proper architecture** - Uses the custom hooks pattern (useWorkspaceController)

## Note About WorkspaceView2.tsx
The file `WorkspaceView2.tsx` still exists but is now **completely unused**. You can safely delete it manually if you wish, but it won't cause any issues since nothing imports from it.

## Benefits of the Refactored Version
The current WorkspaceView.tsx (formerly WorkspaceView2):
- Uses `useWorkspaceController` hook for state management
- Separates concerns into smaller, focused components
- Better maintainability and testability
- Cleaner code organization

## Canvas Update Issue
Regarding your previous concern about canvas not updating when changing settings (grid, opacity, etc.), the refactored version properly handles these updates through the controller hooks and reactive state management.
